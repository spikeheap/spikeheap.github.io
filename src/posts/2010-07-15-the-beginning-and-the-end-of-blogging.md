description: For a moment, I thought writing about code in Wordpress was hard
---
~~OK, so I almost started using this blog again. I came pretty close. But then I tried to use the (granted very free) Wordpress.com site to blog about software development. No plugins and no syntax highlighting for code. So I am out of here, probably to procrastinate and set up a blog on my own server.~~

Maybe I was a bit presumptuous, and have found a well-documented but poorly advertised feature of Wordpress: [Source code highlighting](http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/).

Right, well there were are, now that I can actually document what I'm doing I'm considerably happier. 

...it will of course sit un-added to for another couple of years.
