On Sunday we ran the second Oxford Code Retreat, so here's a few notes I've made about the event, and more generally about organising events

## The JSOxford Summer of Hacks Code Retreat

Okay, so it's not a super-snappy title, but the [Summer of Hacks](http://jsoxford.com/2014/summer-of-hacks/) has been a great success so far. The Code Retreat was the second event in the series, and this time we did it for Ruby, Python and JavaScript.

Removing the language restriction was quite nice, and although we initially had a 90/10 split of JavaScript/Python for the first session that evened out to 50/50 after lunch. No dedicated Rubyists turned up, but Pete still managed to test out his Ruby test runner.

The nice thing about the Code Retreat format is that it plays well to most languages, so running Python and JavaScript alongside each other didn't require any special tooling. I'm a huge fan of polyglot events (being a multilinguist myself), and it was great to see a mix of people rather than the JavaScripters at one end and Pythonistas at the other.

The turnout for this event was completely different to the last event, and it was great to see the majority who turned up were testing/pair programming newbies. We had intended to make TDD/pair programming secondary, but through each session we had a reasonably constant flow of TDD-related questions so that obviously didn't happen!

One of the things I love about events like this is questioning the basics. A couple of times I was faced with questions about TDD taking too long or appearing to be a big time drain, and whereas online you might just dismiss questions like that with "they just don't get it", it has really helped me clarify my reason for loving TDD and think about the inherent tradeoffs and assumptions.

So because I made everyone suffer my retrospectives on Sunday, here's my quick retro:

#### What went well?
TODO

#### What could have gone better?

- explaining meaning afterwards.

#### What have I learned?

### Summary
Each time I've run a Code Retreat there are things I'd do completely differently next time, and to be honest it would be boring if that weren't the case. As always it was an interesting event, and hopefully the attendees got as much out of it as I did. 

A few people have written up the day. If you've done the same let me know and I'll add you to the list below:

## Some notes on organising
I should probably split this off into another blog post but if I did that its likely not get published for a while. Having run a couple of Code Retreats now I thought it would be good to put the things I've learned down, and some thoughts on what I would/will do next time.


### Being the organiser
If you're thinking about organising an event, I can't recommend it enough. Setting a date and shouting about it a little will give you a great idea of how many people might turn up, and other enthusiastic people will come out of the woodwork and help. I was lucky enough to have the amazing [Ben](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=benjaminbenben) helping out with both events and generally getting me excited about getting involved with the community.

It's hard work, and the first one is definitely a little stressful, but when it's free and you're giving up your time attendees are mostly supportive and forgiving of the little mistakes.

### When to run it
We ran the second Code Retreat on a Sunday because our preferred venue wasn't available on Saturday. Surprisingly it didn't affect our turnout, but I'd still recommenend a Saturday for a couple of reasons:

1. You can justify staying in the pub longer afterwards
2. You can spend Sunday patting yourself on the back and taking a little rest

We started the first retreat at 8am, because we were synchronising with other events around Europe, and the second at 10am. You can guess which one had a better turnout! Starting and ending later is good because it means you (and the attendees) still get that weekend feeling, and later finishes mean you're more likely to have a good-sized group sticking around for a drink afterwards.

### Entry fees
For the first Code Retreat we had ~40% turnout.

### Sponsorship

### Food

### After party!
We're getting better at pushing the afterparty. Mention that you're heading to a bar/cafe/whatever post-event right at the beginning, and keep plugging it through the day. If you bring it up just before everyone leaves they're already in the 'going home' mindset and might even have made plans through the day.

It's worth pushing people to have a bit of collective downtime after the event. It's a chance to get some informal feedback but more importantly it brings everyone together to talk about whatever they want â€“ at least some of that will be about what they've gained from the day.
