## Some notes on organising
I should probably split this off into another blog post but if I did that its likely not get published for a while. Having run a couple of Code Retreats now I thought it would be good to put the things I've learned down, and some thoughts on what I would/will do next time.


### Being the organiser
If you're thinking about organising an event, I can't recommend it enough. Setting a date and shouting about it a little will give you a great idea of how many people might turn up, and other enthusiastic people will come out of the woodwork and help. I was lucky enough to have the amazing [Ben](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=benjaminbenben) helping out with both events and generally getting me excited about getting involved with the community.

It's hard work, and the first one is definitely a little stressful, but when it's free and you're giving up your time attendees are mostly supportive and forgiving of the little mistakes.

### When to run it
We ran the second Code Retreat on a Sunday because our preferred venue wasn't available on Saturday. Surprisingly it didn't affect our turnout, but I'd still recommenend a Saturday for a couple of reasons:

1. You can justify staying in the pub longer afterwards
2. You can spend Sunday patting yourself on the back and taking a little rest

We started the first retreat at 8am, because we were synchronising with other events around Europe, and the second at 10am. You can guess which one had a better turnout! Starting and ending later is good because it means you (and the attendees) still get that weekend feeling, and later finishes mean you're more likely to have a good-sized group sticking around for a drink afterwards.

### Entry fees
For the first Code Retreat we had ~40% turnout. We've found that a side-effect of making the event free has been that people are eager to sign up but don't necessarily commit to attending. For evening events this is less of an issue, but a full-day session needs catering and sponsorship and it's pretty difficult to organise either without a good idea of participant numbers.

One approach we could have taken is to just expect ~50% to turn up, but if it's particularly popular, some other event gets cancelled, or even if it rains then turnout could be prohibitively high.

We decided to take a different approach and charge a nominal entry fee of £5. After Eventbrite's fee this would leave ~£3.50 per person, which we then put towards the costs of morning pastries. Eventbrite allows refunds to be given so anyone who let us know they weren't coming could get their money back. We found this worked well and meant we only had a couple of no-shows, and we'll definitely consider doing it again until we find a way to make it free but still get the emotional buy-in that comes with a small financial contribution. Perhaps something like a £5 deposit which you get back when you turn up might work...

### Sponsorship
TODO

### Food
TODO

### After party!
We're getting better at pushing the afterparty. Mention that you're heading to a bar/cafe/whatever post-event right at the beginning, and keep plugging it through the day. If you bring it up just before everyone leaves they're already in the 'going home' mindset and might even have made plans through the day.

It's worth pushing people to have a bit of collective downtime after the event. It's a chance to get some informal feedback but more importantly it brings everyone together to talk about whatever they want – at least some of that will be about what they've gained from the day.

### Using Code Retreat to lead into a hack

The Code Retreat format is great and I think it can really foster thoughtful discussions about language specifics and development in general. However, both events I've been involved with have felt a little slower in the afternoon, and some of the feedback we've received suggested that the later sessions were less useful.

If/when we run another code retreat, I will seriously consider splitting the day in half so the code retreat in the morning gets everyong thinking about their development approach and code quality. The afternoon could then be set aside to something practical and output-driven such as a group hack. Curating the afternoon session to subtly build on the morning's focus could be an effective way to reinforce the learning, and would also help bring more energy to the afternoon.
