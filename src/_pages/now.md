Updated on the 1st of October 2025

After two and a half years helping Hackney Council I finished up yesterday, and I'm spending the next few months as parental leave looking after my son before he starts nursery. I'm incredibly lucky and privileged to be able to do this as â€“ The UK still has very gendered views on maternity/parental leave so taking extended leave isn't taken for granted. 

In January I'll be on the hunt for a new role. The last few months have been quite intense so I'm very much looking forward to a mix of downtime from work, catching up with everyone I've lost touch with this year, and planning what's next.
