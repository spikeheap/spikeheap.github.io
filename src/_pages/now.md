Most of my summer was spent finding edge-cases in home renovation â€“ redecorating a bedroom turned into an epic including partially rebuilding a wall. I'm almost over it, but still feeling a bit bitter about how hard it is to find quality local tradespeople.

I've been helping a London council build up their cyber security capabilities. It still feels good to be able to work with local and central government, as there are still so many places to have a big impact on people's lives.

I've also recently picked up the guitar again and started lessons for the first time. The learning process for an instrument isn't something I've done since I was a kid, and I've strangely enjoyed going back to being a novice and taking direction.
