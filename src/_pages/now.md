## Decompressing after leaving the civil service

I've just left Government Digital Service's GOV.UK group after 3 years in civil service. Helping the HM Prison & Probation Service and GOV.UK has been a heady mix of rewarding and frustrating times, and I'm taking a couple of months to unwind and reflect on that time. I met a lot of good people, all working hard to do their best in sometimes challenging conditions.

This also means I'll be looking for new opportunities in early 2023.

## Reading for professional development

I've not read any tech or business books since my daughter was born at the beginning of the year and I've got a big pile waiting for me. I've just picked up [Docs for Developers](https://docsfordevelopers.com) and remembered how good it was on first reading. 

## Hacking an espresso machine

I'm fitting the [gaggiuino mod](https://gaggiuino.github.io) to my Gaggia Classic espresso machine, in the hope it'll make up for my lack of skill and make shots tastier ðŸ¤”. So far I've blown the control board up and had *several* catastropic pressure line failures, but we might be almost there.

## Running Remote Hack

The last Saturday of each month is always [Remote Hack](https://remotehack.space). We've been running events consistently since early in the pandemic, and they're now wonderfully low-key and relaxing (except for when my espresso machine shorted the house electrics). With a young daughter, it's also the only time I've set aside to hack on things and chat tech outside of work.
