Waiting, on the cusp of our second child being born. After a busy few months renovating the house and wading through illnesses brought back from preschool, there's only a couple of things that actually _need_ to be done. It's refreshing to wake up and not be faced by a mountain of To Do items. 

This will be the first year in a while where we've completed our renovation plans for the year before summer. I cannot express how happy I am that I'll not be in a room stripping wallpaper in 30℃.

I'm also on the edge of stability. After some last-minute renewals my latest contract bid is long or bust. I've learned a lot about keeping sanguine in the face of things I can't change here – the tension between wanting to carefully plan finances for family changes and potentially being contract-free is certainly there, but the option of a summer off with a newborn isn't a bad one.
