## Preparing for a new role 

I'm really excited to be joining Bookwhen in January. I've worked with a few from the team before, and it's always a privilege to have someone want to work with me again. I'm looking forward to the faster pace and agility that's inherent in smaller organisations (than government in particular).

## Resting after COVID++ 

COVID in November wiped my immune system out, so I've been catching the worst variant of every bug my daughter brings back from nursery. After ending up on antibiotics for a chest infection, I'm taking it very easy this month

## Decompressing after leaving the civil service

I've just left Government Digital Service's GOV.UK group after 3 years in civil service. Helping the HM Prison & Probation Service and GOV.UK has been a heady mix of rewarding and frustrating times, and I'm taking a couple of months to unwind and reflect on that time. I met a lot of good people, all working hard to do their best in sometimes challenging conditions.

## Hacking an espresso machine

I'm using my [gaggiuino modded](https://gaggiuino.github.io) Gaggia Classic espresso machine, after a bunch of (self-inflicted) problems with the installation. It's still only half-finished really though, with loads of wires poking out of the top cover waiting for me to get around to finishing it off.

## Running Remote Hack

~~The last Saturday of each month is always [Remote Hack](https://remotehack.space). We've been running events consistently since early in the pandemic, and they're now wonderfully low-key and relaxing (except for when my espresso machine shorted the house electrics). With a young daughter, it's also the only time I've set aside to hack on things and chat tech outside of work.~~

We're taking December off from Remote Hack (it'll be New Year's Eve, so there are other things to be doing).
