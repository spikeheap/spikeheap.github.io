DIY. Lots of DIY. We're renovating our house slowly, and learning that there's complexity and nuance in almost every job. It's helping me become less of a perfectionist for large jobs, and is reenforcing the value of [15% solutions](https://medium.com/the-liberators/trigger-big-change-by-starting-small-with-15-solutions-3d463ff1c38a) over paralysingly-large plans that cost more in time and money than you really want to spend. It's also really motivating to see iterative improvement all around you. The little things matter.

I'm also getting to spend more time learning the guitar. I've owned one since I was a teenager, but it's only in the last year that I've recruited a tutor and made a concerted effort to learn the theory. Starting to learn something new(ish) at 40 with all the time constraints of family life is refreshing and intimidating in equal measure. Gone are the days when I could just spend all my free time on one thing, so it's teaching me a lot of patience to slowly grow through practice.
