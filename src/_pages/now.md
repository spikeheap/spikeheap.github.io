With the start of summer I'm rediscovering my love for running, cycling and the outdoors after an enforced hiatus. I'm having to fight my tendency to push myself as I slowly rebuild after COVID, but few things beat a long self-powered journey in a remote place. I'm working on the balance of parenting and these longer solo activities â€“ and I don't want to miss out on either!

I've just stepped back into contracting and consulting after a few years in employment. I really appreciate the slow pendulum swing, and being able to incorporate skills and experiences from the different ways of working. I'm having to remember the intricacies of running a small business again though. Things like timesheeting, invoicing and accounting are a fairly distant memory!

## Running Remote Hack

We celebrated [Remote Hack](https://remotehack.space)'s 3rd birthday in March. Three years have flown by, and it was interesting to reflect on how different life is now. Remote Hack has always been a pleasure. Part of what makes it great is how low-effort it is, for organisers as well participants.
