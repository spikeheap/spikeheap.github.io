A lot has changed over the last few months since I updated this:

## Moving into contracting and consulting

After a few months helping Bookwhen, I'm moving back into the interim CTO and contracting game. It was really nice to spend a stint helping them reboot their technical and product processes, and introduce things like infrastructure-as-code, and it reminded me how much satisfaction I get from working as if I won't always be there by baking things into documentation, process and the way everyone works.

I'm taking a little time for house renovations and for adventures in the Peak District with my daughter, but I'll be looking for new opportunities very soon.

## I gave up hacking my espresso machine

I had a [gaggiuino modded](https://gaggiuino.github.io) Gaggia Classic espresso machine, but it turns out I'm more interested in learning about making good coffee than managing hardware and software first thing in the morning. It's not a reflection on the open-source project, but a few repeating minor hardware failures wore me down. I've now got a La Marzocco Linea Micra and it's been very relaxing!

## Running Remote Hack

We celebrated [Remote Hack](https://remotehack.space)'s 3rd birthday in March. Three years have flown by, and it was interesting to reflect on how different life is now. Remote Hack has always been a pleasure. Part of what makes it great is how low-effort it is, for organisers as well participants.
