I was a bit dazed when I came off my bike and rolled down the road. Having got past the initial joy of ‚Äúall my limbs still work, ish‚Äù, through the thankfullness of seeing the big dent in the front of my helmet, and into ‚Äúow, my face actually hurts quite a bit‚Äù, I realised this had been an expensive mistake.

The bike came out of things pretty well, and just needed the mech hanger bending out, a new GRX shifter and some bar tape. The hardest part of getting that back on the road was sourcing the shifter, with both Shimano and SRAM components being in short supply this year. My clothing was another story‚Ä¶

Suprisingly enough, most road cycling clothing isn‚Äôt built to be bounced along the tarmac, and I managed to damage everything I was wearing except my shoes (thankfully my ready-to-be-replaced overshoes took the brunt of that damage). I‚Äôd picked a terrible time to do this, as a few things were really new. My 3-week-old Castelli bib tights had a big hole in them, and my month-old POC helmet had a big dent too. For some context on how pleased I was with Rapha, I‚Äôve been comparing them with these two brands:

*   POC ignored tweets and a couple of emails. They mention a crash replacement programme in North America, but not Europe, but I never got an answer about whether they do or not. The helmet was amazing, but the service less so.
*   Castelli‚Äôs [UK replacement policy](https://saddleback.co.uk/pages/crash-replacement/) is oddly complex, with extra discount if you‚Äôve bought directly from Saddleback. This one was the most frustrating ‚Äî the almost-new bib tights needed a replacement panel, and it felt very wasteful having them destroyed for 40% discount on a full-RRP set. In the end I picked up a brand new set from [Sigma Sports](https://www.sigmasports.com/item/Castelli/Sorpasso-ROS-Bib-Tight/R1RC) with a reasonable discount (though not 40%), and am waiting for Alpkit‚Äôs repair stations to open up as lockdown lifts. Hopefully I‚Äôll end up with a slightly scrappy pair for mountain biking ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The thinnest, lightest thing I was wearing was my Rapha Brevet high-visibility jacket, which came off peppered with holes and a couple of tears. I _love_ this jacket. It‚Äôs reflective stripes are perfect for winter riding when you end up in the dark more often, and it still packed down small and breathes really well. Maybe a little too well after the fall‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs a few ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photos

Of all the damaged clothing, this was the one I assumed was destined for the bin. It‚Äôs a couple of years old, and a very fine material.

I knew Rapha had a [free repairs service](https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/repair-service), but couldn‚Äôt find anything on the internet other than a forum post that said they‚Äôd got a free replacement and it had taken 5 weeks. With nothing to lose, I took the photos above, sent them to Rapha and had it in the post the next day.

Three and a half weeks later a package turned up, and in a nice little ‚Äúfirst aid‚Äù tote bag was my repaired jacket. Here are a few photos of their handiwork:

{% include gallery caption="Some neat repairs. The back patch covers the reflective tape and is quite obvious, but that was a really damaged section." %}

I‚Äôm more than satisfied with the repair. Sure, it‚Äôs no longer as-new, and the back panel adds a little more bulk to the jacket, but when there‚Äôs all the other expenses of replacing clothing and components I couldn‚Äôt be happier that I‚Äôve not had to shell out (excuse the pun) on a new jacket.

Five stars, but I hope I don‚Äôt need to use the service again anytime soon!
