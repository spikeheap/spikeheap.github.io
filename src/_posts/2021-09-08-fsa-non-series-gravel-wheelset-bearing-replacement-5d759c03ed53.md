My Sonder Camino Ti arrived in November 2020 with the [FSA Non-Series off-road wheelset](https://shop.fullspeedahead.com/en/wheelsets/mtb-gravel/non-series-off-road-wheelset). After 9 months of mixed British riding, including a long, gritty winter in the Peak District, both wheels developed a bit of play and looked like they needed new bearings.

FSA/Vision have technical documents with [lists of service parts](https://shop.fullspeedahead.com/en/files/index/download/id/b2ff4887328d298e4187533fdf15a551357/) for the wheels, but these use non-standard part names, and mapping these to the international standard was only possible once I stripped the wheels down and read them off the bearings themselves.

Front wheel
-----------

*   Vision/FSA code: MR199
*   Actual size: 15x26x7mm
*   Quantity: 2
*   Bearing code: 15267–2RS (2RS just means there are 2 rubber seals, which helps protect the bearing from grime)

These can be removed with a [bearing puller](https://www.bearingprotools.com/products/bearing-puller?variant=32121629343849), and refitted with a standard bearing press with 15x26x7mm drifts, such as [this one](https://www.bearingprotools.com/collections/presses/products/bearing-press-for-bicycles-with-t-bar-handles?variant=32895187189865).

Rear wheel
----------

*   Vision/FSA code: MR200
*   Actual size: 17x28x7mm
*   Quantity: 2
*   Bearing code: 17287–2RS (2RS just means there are 2 rubber seals, which helps protect the bearing from grime)
*   The freehub contains a couple of the same bearings, but I couldn’t remove them, and ended up ordering [a full replacement freehub (EL298)](https://www.velozone.co.uk/products/vision-non-series-wheels-sh11-el298-freehub).

As these have different dimensions, they need a slightly different-sized [bearing puller](https://www.bearingprotools.com/products/bearing-puller?variant=32121629147241).

To fit/refit the bearings, you’ll need [a press with over-axle drifts](https://www.bearingprotools.com/collections/presses/products/over-axle-bearing-press?variant=32243512508521) because the captive axle gets in the way of a standard press once you have the first bearing in. There’s also a cheaper alternative approach if you have a socket set — Youtube is your friend there.

I’ve found [Henderson Bearings](https://www.hendersonbearings.co.uk) to ship quickly and last a decent time, though I don’t know enough to say whether their “Enduro” branding is just marketing or a lot better for bikes.
