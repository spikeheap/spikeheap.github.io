-- or, "what's in a title?"

You need technical representation within the leadership team of (almost) any startup. It's tempting to focus on getting the engineers to build your product/service/site first, but without technical guidance within the leadership it's easy for important technical considerations to be overlooked or downplayed.

Be explicit about the compromises you're making. The main tenet of 'Agile' is "people over process", so it's ironic that Scrum has become one of the most festidiously documented and policed term in modern sofware development. 

The problem with Scrum is that it's often not 'agile' enough. It's tempting to sacrifice some of the core values of the scrum, such as immovable time-boxed sprints, not altering the scope of the sprint once it's commenced, and allowing the developers to pick the number of issues they'll commit to delivering. Each of these attributes feels like it slows things down, and it's certainly appropriate to break them in an emergency.

But what constitutes an emergency? Often, we see compromises made for valid reasons, but without the explicit justification, and this is a slippery slope. Skip forward 6 months and you could well be adding and removing items from the sprint just because the priorities have changed overnight, or pushing individual issues as being paramount because they're a pet project for someone. Be wary of these tell-tales.
