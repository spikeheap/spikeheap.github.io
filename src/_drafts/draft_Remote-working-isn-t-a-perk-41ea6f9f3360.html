If you’re offering remote working a couple of days a week, you might just be doing it all wrong

Companies are being forced to find new ways to differentiate themselves to candidates, and quite a few recruiters have helped these companies realise that they can widen the net by offering remote aspects of work. All in all, this is a pretty promising progression.</p><p name="e3a8" id="e3a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s just one problem: companies are starting to embrace remote as a perk, rather than a way to manage operations, and from what I’ve seen this leads to a mismatch of expectations with candidates, an environment where remote working is less sustainable, and a conflict of objectives.</p><h4 name="e7b7" id="e7b7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">First, some assumptions</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="24de" id="24de" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">TODO assume we’re talking about remote-first</li><li name="d22b" id="d22b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">TODO assume employees are remote-compatible</li><li name="4f7b" id="4f7b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">TODO remote-first doesn’t mean remote-only</li><li name="5511" id="5511" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">TODO we agree that remote is beneficial</li></ul><h4 name="3f7a" id="3f7a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">By making it a perk, you feel like you’re doing the candidate a favour</h4><p name="15a3" id="15a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If we approach remote as something to minimise, there’s always going to be a tension between the employee/contractor and the company. I’ve had conversations with recruiters along the lines of “how many days would need to be remote for this role to be right for you”. The answer to that is always the same: </p><blockquote name="c589" id="c589" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">What would I be doing that would require me to be in the office? Travelling in for meetings, planning events, hack days, retros, etc. is absolutely fine, but sitting on a train for two hours one day to sit at a desk when I did the same work remotely the day before doesn’t make much sense.</blockquote><p name="3a29" id="3a29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">When remote working is used as a bargaining chip in this way, it comes across as being about having bums-on-seats, rather than empowering people to do their best work from the right place.</p><h4 name="a33c" id="a33c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What is the right place?</h4><p name="1943" id="1943" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Everyone’s different, and what’s right may change over time. Some of the most talented developers I’ve worked with have really struggled to concentrate in an open-plan office environment with all the distractions and noise that that can entail, and switching to a home office has made the world of difference to their happiness and productivity. Others have had the opposite, where working remotely meant late mornings and a constant connection to work which ground them down, but they thrived being able to silo work by travelling home at the end of the day. The right place can even change for a single person over time — I find the quiet, distraction-free environment of my home-office, with the hipster standing desk/iMac setup ideal for architecting and writing code, but I find it easier to write prose with the bustle of a coffee shop in the background.</p><p name="7074" id="7074" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key is to empower people to identify what works best for them, and make the most of it.</p><h4 name="4643" id="4643" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Great, but we have a lot of face-to-face meetings</h4><p name="1623" id="1623" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Some things are undoubtedly easier face-to-face, especially at the beginning of your journey to remote working. However it’s also a common cop-out to save us having to think about how we make the company work for remote workers. Meetings are an obvious example of where you might expect people to be in the office, but are there other ways remote workers might lose out? Are architectural decisions made over coffee in the kitchen? Does the project manager come over and ask how people are doing? If you’re not replicating this into channels where remote workers can take part, they’ll likely feel excluded, and if they’re part remote that means they’re more likely to travel into the office more so they don’t miss out. With more people in the office more often the effects are compounded until remote working is just something people do when they have someone coming over to fix the boiler one day.</p><h4 name="7bb7" id="7bb7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">So, what can we do?</h4><p name="0746" id="0746" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">TODO — start by allowing a sample of current employees to work from home. Interview them about how it felt. Identify friction and experiment with remote-first alternatives</p><p name="f976" id="f976" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TODO — some obvious places to start: All decisions are recorded in the issue tracker. Ask/talk about architecture on Slack. Async PRs on GitHub. Test a couple of standups over Skype. Make sure non-remote developers have headsets and can do remote from the office.</p><p name="85ad" id="85ad" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="874c" id="874c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="d7bf" id="d7bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TODO The amazing thing about remote work is that it benefits both parties.
