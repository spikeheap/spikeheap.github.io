Finding good people is hard, and finding the right technical leader when you're in the first stages of starting up is even harder. I'm not sure it's necessary.

<!-- more -->

Let's start with a caveat: this doesn't apply if you're building something technically challenging or innovative (and I mean *really* innovative). When you're working on the boundaries of what's technically feasible you need a technical leader from day one, on the board of directors. 

All companies these days use technology, right? You can't start a business without a website, and a good proportion of that type of startup is based solely through the web. Sure, you've got marketing, sales and support, but the website is the primary form of interaction. It might be selling a product or a service, or just providing information and promotion. How does this fit with the modern CTO/lead developer/senior engineer?

We can refine this set even further, to the groups of businesses who rely on technology to enable innovative behaviour. These businesses require systems and websites beyond just a simple static site or CMS, but are they true technology companies? I've certainly seen a good number which are started entirely by non-technical directors who generally have exceptional domain knowledge and see technology forming an integral part of the business. 

Assuming you're not outsourcing the technical work entirely, that leaves you with a few options for how the technical leader fits in the organisation (I've added capitalisation for gravitas):

1. Technical Director
2. CTO
3. Technical Lead
4. Developer

Titles are pretty meaningless, so this is better expressed as the level of responsibility:

1. Business owner. Responsible for the business' success.
2. Senior management, non-owner. Responsible to a director for the direction, focus and strategic growth of the technology.
3. Technical Lead, responsible for delivering the realisation of the plans and roadmap, as laid out by senior management/directors.
4. Developer, responsible for carrying out development tasks.

The above is a **gross** oversimplification, and will undoubtedly incense anyone who's sensitive about titles, but the purpose is to demonstrate the increasing level of ownership associated with the roles. That's not to say this is how it really works in practice. I've met several CTOs who are really just implementing a series of features at the whim of the owners, and I've equally seen developers who are trusted to make high-level strategic decisions on the technical direction of the company. This got me thinking: if the level of ownership and control varies so wildly even within what we think are well defined roles, how important is it to recruit a CTO or Technical Director during the first phase of the business?

TODO
- Directors often come together through common experience in a field, so bringing in an unknown quantity feels risky
- Technical Directors are rare, and hard to get good alignment with directors
- CTOs are expensive, and experience in once company doesn't necessarily translate to another.
- Good technical leaders and CTOs are often grown out of exceptional developers and tech leads.
- Tech Leads are often scared to apply for CTO roles because they lack experience of the title

Solution? 
- Focus on hiring great people - you may be hiring your CTO/Director without knowing it
- Constantly think about growing your team internally, even though you're a startup.
- Empower everyone, and promote responsibility.
- Temporary technical leadership - consultants... Focus on building a great team and frontload some of the technical development. 

But
- be careful about creating mythical code by consultants that can't be maintained... unless you intend to throw it away...

SO: prove the business model, and everything else will follow, just don't be afraid to throw things away and start again.
