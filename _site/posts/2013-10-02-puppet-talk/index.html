<p>Here are the slides from a presentation on Puppet I gave at the <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWBangor">Software Alliance Wales</a> lightning lunch on 27th September 2013:</p>

<p>The source for those slides is available at https://github.com/spikeheap/saw-meet-puppet-talk. </p>

<p>If you need to build a simple presentation I’d definitely recommend <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">Reveal.js</a>. There are a good number of open-source presentation engines emerging now, and it’s great to see open tools (finally) competing with Keynote/Powerpoint for simplicity. For simple presentations it blows them out of the water.</p>

<p><em>If you want something swanky or want an open-source competitor to <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> check out http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored. It’s amazing, but was a little too heavy for the presentation at the top of this post!</em></p>

<p>My requirements were pretty simple: the day before the lightning talk I needed to drop some code examples onto a couple of slides to demonstrate the Puppet syntax. I don’t have Keynote, LibreOffice or Powerpoint installed on my iMac. I also didn’t want to have to take my laptop to the talk.</p>

<p><a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">Reveal.js</a> was pretty much the top Google hit, and offers a very simple setup: a HTML file which you add slides to, and a bunch of supporting CSS and Javascript. The slideshow is trivial to run because it’s just a webpage. Anyone with a modern browser which goes full screen would do fine to present with.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed throwing the slides together because this process separates the content from the style, so you just get on with making things more interesting.</p>
