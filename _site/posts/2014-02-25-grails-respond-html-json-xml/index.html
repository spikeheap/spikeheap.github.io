<p>The new(ish) support for <code>respond</code> in Grails 2.3 is great, and saves us the hassle of specifying different render/response calls depending on the content type. Surpisingly it falters when it comes to returning exceptions and errors, for example <code>404 NOT FOUND</code>. This post describes a simple workaround which provides a meaningful response to a JSON/XML request as well as a user-friendly rendered 404 exception for humans.</p>

<p>The obvious approach is to respond with the object:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/spikeheap/9213738.js?file=1_obvious_approach.groovy"> </script>

<p>The above works great for basic JSON/XML requests, as it returns a 404 status code and no content. The main problem is that it doesn’t render HTML responses, so a user is presented with a blank page. Not so nice.</p>

<p>The following will quite happily respond with the correct content type for a valid widget, but if the widget doesn’t exist a 404 HTML page and 404 status code are returned (even if you requested JSON/XML):</p>

<p>We’re almost there, but not quite. We can use the <code>respond</code> method and manually pass back the HTTP status and the view:</p>

<p>Hey presto, 404 error pages for HTML users, and a blank 404 response for JSON/XML requests. Obviously the above assumes you have a view named <code>error404.gsp</code> to display a pretty 404 error page.</p>

<p>It might be a bit nicer if our JSON and XML responses contained a similar amount of information, and if we could pass some contextual information to the view (for example the type of thing we couldn’t find). No problem, just define a map with our response objects and then define that same map as the view model, along with the status code and view:</p>

<p>Let’s break the 404 response down a little.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>if(!widget)</code> is a Groovy way of checking for null/empty values</li>
  <li>The model we’re going to return has an obvious failure notification because we’ve set <code>success</code> to <code>false</code>, but we’ve added a little more information by saying the widget couldn’t be found.</li>
  <li>The first argument to <code>respond</code> is <code>model as Object</code>. This tells <code>respond</code> to use <code>model</code> for the JSON and XML responses. The coercion is required to prevent an error because of ambiguous arguments.</li>
  <li>The second argument to <code>respond</code> is <code>[model: model, status: 404, view: 'error404']</code>, which provides the view arguments so the correct 404 GSP is loaded. The <code>model</code> specified here is the same as is used for the JSON/XML response, so the GSP has access to the same information to render to the user.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>So there we have it: a simple way to <code>respond</code> and please all our sources. It’s not quite elegant, and I’m going to see how easy it would be to roll this into the <code>respond</code> method itself. </p>

<p>Is there a better way? Let me know in the comments!</p>
