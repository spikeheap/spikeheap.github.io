<p>I’m trying to force myself to be a better contributor to the software development community, and part of that is writing up my rough notes each time I solve an interesting technical problem.</p>

<p>To do that I’m using this Wordpress blog, and Textmate because it makes me far more likely to write the article in the first place. It also solves a problem I’ve had a few times where formatting or source is changed once you upload the article, and by keeping a local copy for the draft I’ve always got something to go back to. </p>

<p>The only problem then is posting source code, which this post is simple test for. If the following works:</p>

<p>then source code formatting works from Textmate, and on to the next challenge!</p>

<p>To blog to Wordpress using Textmate, you first need to add your blog to the bundle’s settings. Once you’ve done that, Ctrl-Shift-Alt-B will tell Textmate to treat your document as a Markdown blog post. From there I’ve added the following:</p>

<pre><code>Title: Blogging about software using Textmate
Slug: blogging-about-software-using-textmate
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve then added source code using the great SyntaxHighlighter plugin by wrapping the code in <strong>sourcecode</strong> tags.</p>

<p>Finally I’ve posted this article to the blog using Ctrl-Command-P. Onwards.</p>
