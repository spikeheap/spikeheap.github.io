<p>I have an ATI Remote Wonder remote, which I’ve been quite happy with for the last couple of years. Not that happy though (or maybe I just like tinkering), because I set about trying to make the remote more responsive. There’s something about having to keep letting go of the button and waiting for it to accept a new press that winds me up when I’m trying to watch a film… <br />
The default lirc  configuration file is an immense improvement in Mythbuntu Lucid, but I started hacking around anyway. <br />
First off was to try the kernel drivers for the X10, which worked, but I couldn’t get any of my lirc settings to affect its behaviour. Switching to the <code>X10 (userspace)</code> drivers made the remote more responsive (and generated <em>many</em> more button presses in irw.<br />
I now have the standard <code>ati_remote_wonder_rf </code>configuration running with one slight tweak - I have changed the repeat rates in <code>~/.lirc/mythtv </code>to 5 (from 0). <br />
Now it behaves like a remote should - and is quick enough for me anyway.</p>
