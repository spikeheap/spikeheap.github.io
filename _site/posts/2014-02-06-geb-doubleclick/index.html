<p>Testing basic interaction with Geb is easy, but the ‘intuitive’ way of doing double-clicks fails silently and without any real indication as to why. Fortunately there’s a simple solution!

<p>My first approach was to use <code>dblClick()</code> in place of <code>click()</code>. The result was a test which compiled and ran, but failed to generate the double click event:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/spikeheap/8845429.js?file=failingSpec.groovy"> </script></p>

<p>It turns out that double-clicking is a “complex interaction”, and because it isn’t used that much on webpages it’s not part of the core functionality of NonEmptyNavigator.</p>

<p>Fortunately building complex interactions is trivial in Geb, so my updated Spock test only needs one line replacing:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/spikeheap/8845429.js?file=passingSpec.groovy"> </script>

<p>Great, on to the next test!</p>

<p>Here’s another example, this time using interactions to do a context-click (right-click to you an me!):</p>

<p>If you want to run the test, the following gradle script will sort you out:
