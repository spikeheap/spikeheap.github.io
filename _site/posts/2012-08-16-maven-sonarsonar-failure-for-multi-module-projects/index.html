<p>After refactoring a small project to manage subversion auth information into multiple Maven modules I started running into what I assume is a fairly common problem: trying to build a child module which depends on an edit applied to a different module which hasn’t been built yet. For some reason the “Set as main project” option has gone from Netbeans 7.2, so I found myself going back to the command line to build each time.</p>

<p>A couple of days later and I’m integrating the project with a local Sonar instance, only to find it fails with a similar message: </p>

<pre><code>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project XXXXXXXX: Could not resolve dependencies for project XXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXX:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT: The following artifacts could not be resolved: XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX: Could not find artifact XXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXX:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT -&gt; [Help 1]
</code></pre>

<p>A bit of digging turned up an issue which claims the problem is solved in Maven 3.2, but that didn’t solve it for me. </p>

<p>At least as an interim, packaging the project prior to running the Sonar plugin does the trick, ensuring that the relevant JARs are available for the sonar plugin’s run:</p>

<pre><code>mvn package sonar:sonar
</code></pre>

<p>Now the only problem is dealing with all the violations I’ve introduced, Bad Ryan!</p>
