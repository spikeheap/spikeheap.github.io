<p>Whilst building an annotation processor for a Seam/Wicket project I’m working on I needed to do a specific action if the annotated field was an <code>enum</code>. Thanks to autoboxing, I accomplished the task using the <code>getType()</code> method and comparing that <code>Class</code> object to the enum I was interested in. It did leave me with a big niggle though, and for the past couple of weeks I’ve been thinking about the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">// Get the type of the field, as a Class object. Note we can't do instanceof on this, because it is a Class.
Class&lt;?&gt; type = field.getType();

//FIXME - make generic for any enum - this will work if we just change the catch criteria here.
if (type == OurEnumOne.class || type == OurClass.NestedEnumOne.class || type == OurEnumTwo.class) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>It’s horribly unmaintainable code for many reasons, but most unforgivably it won’t match any other enums, so every time we want to add support for a new enum we need to modify the class this resides in - nasty!</p>

<p>At first this doesn’t seem like it should be a problem, but the obvious solution (to get an instance of the field and just use <code>instanceof</code>) involves some convoluted reflection which will no doubt introduce bugs later on.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the real solution is a) more elegant, b) simpler, c) not likely to introduce bugs and d) applicable to all cases like this. Every class has an <code>isAssignableFrom(Class test)</code> method, which evaluates whether the calling class is a superclass or the same class as the test parameter, so the following returns true for any enum:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">if(Enum.class.isAssignableFrom(type)){ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks autoboxing!</p>
