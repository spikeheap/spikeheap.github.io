If you haven’t already, I’d urge you to <a href="http://www.mndassociation.org/get-involved/donations">consider donating</a> to this worth cause and to find out more about the disease and how it affects people.</p> <p>It seems like a no-brainer, right? Not quite. Yesterday I was nominated and all of my misgivings were brought to the fore. Do I just do&hellip;

		    <p>On the 23rd of August we ran the last event in the <a href="http://jsoxford.com/2014/summer-of-hacks/">JSOxford 2014 Summer of Hacks</a>, building JavaScript powered NodeBots.

		    <p>When we needed to quickly build a proof-of-concept to test a set of SOAP services I thought: “this is perfect for Groovy, and it’s DSL support will mean talking to SOAP won’t require stub generation or any of that pain”. I was almost right. </p> <p><strong>TLDR;</strong> My client script is <a href="https://gist.github.com/spikeheap/b5428f11834a0cea3822">available as a GitHub gist</a> for cannibalisation.</p> <!-- more --> <p>SOAP is <em>almost</em> legacy, but it’s still the only way to interface with large enterprise systems, at least in healthcare.
