A few components later, and the relatively simple proof of concept is complete. This post is a summary of what I‚Äôve done and learned, in case I forget it all next week.</p><!-- more --><h2 id=firstly-a-disclaimer>Firstly, a disclaimer</h2><p>Okay, so it‚Äôs obvious but I have to say it: messing around with mains electricity is dangerous and you could end up getting a pretty big shock (literally). If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt fancy killing yourself (and potentially other people), get someone else to do it! Everything here is provided without any kind of assurance that it will work for you. Basically, don‚Äôt blame me if you do something that gets someone electrocuted or causes your house to burn down. You have been warned (I do enjoy a bit of melodrama)!</p><h2 id=the-set-up>The set up</h2><p><img src=http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r788/spikeheap/stone_walls_zps9aa0e25a.jpg alt="Thick stone walls and single-glazing. A challenge!"> The use case for our automatic heating system is a little different to normal. We have the pleasure of having 4 LPG bottles fuelling a Worcester 24CDi combi-boiler. This is controlled by a thermostat mounted in the hallway by the front door as well as a simple programmer located just by the boiler.</p><p><img src=http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r788/spikeheap/lpg_zpsc04b89c3.jpg alt="LPG bottles, the bane of a warm house"> <small>LPG bottles, the bane of a warm house</small></p><p>The programmer is in-line with the main power supply to the boiler, so outside of the programmed heating times there is also no hot water. The thermostat (thankfully) just controls the heating.</p><h2 id=aims>Aims</h2><p>The flaws in the original setup are pretty obvious, but it‚Äôs always good to write down what you‚Äôre trying to achieve (otherwise how will you know you‚Äôve succeeded?), so for phase 1 my aims were:</p><ol><li>Heating control which doesn‚Äôt affect the hot water supply</li><li>Simple configurable programs for different heating times on different days using cron</li><li>A web interface to switch the heating on and off (for Jennifer)</li></ol><p>As we‚Äôre entering winter and it‚Äôs pretty cold at the moment we don‚Äôt actually need a thermostat. Living in a stone house has (for us) meant that we could run the heating permanently and still not feel compelled to remove our jumpers. I also want to tie the logic of switching the heating on and off into a more intelligent system than just using the current temperature, so it‚Äôs a job for phase 2.</p><h2 id=hacking-into-the-central-heating-system>Hacking into the central heating system</h2><p>There are a number of ways to break into the central heating system. Because the boiler also services the hot water system I didn‚Äôt want to just switch the entire unit on/off, so had to use the thermostat interface of the boiler. There is a handy wireless thermostat fascia for most Worcester boilers, and if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have one of those you can fairly simply spoof it, which is a much less invasive way to get into the system.</p><p><img src=http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r788/spikeheap/installation-and-servicing-instructions-for-24cdi-rsf--discontinued-07pdf__page_12_of_42_-2_zps11b4a374.png alt="Worcester 24CDi thermostat wiring"> The boiler has a 230V room thermostat connection. I wanted to keep that in the system as a fail-safe. If the clever system dies or becomes self-aware and tries to take over the world we don‚Äôt want the pipes to freeze (that would be expensive). Keeping the existing thermostat wired in parallel and turned down to ~5¬∞C means that if it gets that cold the heating will come on regardless. Well, assuming we haven‚Äôt run out of gas (again) at least.</p><p>The thermostat is the logical point to tap into the circuit. It has screw-terminals for easier installation and the thermostat is closer to my ideal mounting location than the boiler. Ours is a pretty standard (and old) Honeywell thermostat (see pictures below). Inside the thermostat is a handy wiring diagram showing the boiler uses 4 connections:</p><ul><li>Live</li><li>Switched live</li><li>Neutral</li><li>Earth (not really a boiler connection, but necessary)</li></ul><p>Closing the switch on the thermostat bridges live and switched live. Just because I‚Äôm paranoid, I double-checked this with a multimeter before adding anything to the system. Rather than building a complete parallel system, I opted to insert a relay to manually close the circuit between live and switched live, but not yet!</p><p><img src=http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r788/spikeheap/thermostat_zps1e3c51eb.jpg alt="The existing thermostat, and wiring points"></p><h2 id=proof-of-concept-simple-pi-control>Proof of concept: simple Pi control</h2><p>Before plugging into the live system, I wanted to prove the system would work in isolation. The components needed are:</p><ol><li>A Raspberry Pi (I‚Äôm using an early rev A Pi, not that it makes any difference) + power supply + SD card @ ~¬£40 total</li><li>A Pi Hut wireless dongle (http://thepihut.com/products/usb-wifi-adapter-for-the-raspberry-pi) @ ¬£8</li><li>A Ciseco ‚Äúslice of relay‚Äù board (http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/slice-of-relay/) @ ¬£10</li><li>A Ciseco POD RTC/EEPROM/Temp (http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/i-o-pod-rtc-eeprom-temp/) @ ¬£11</li><li>3m 5A cable</li></ol><p>If you‚Äôve got a Pi sitting around doing nothing it‚Äôs a pretty cheap project.</p><p>When my components turned up (Ciseco get points for a very fast turnaround) I needed to solder the RTC/temperature sensor cable into the relay board. If you‚Äôre doing this ‚Äúproperly‚Äù you want to get hold of a 2x13 header pin and solder that onto the expansion holes in the slice of relay, but I was feeling cheap and wanting to get everything up and running.</p><p>The relay board uses GPIO pins 24 &amp; 25 (as well as the 5V &amp; ground pins). The RTC/temperature sensor runs on 3V3 and ground pins as well as the SDA and SCL pins for i2c communication, so can be safely added on top of the relay.</p><!-- TODO photo of the complete unit--><p><img src=http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r788/spikeheap/completepi_zpseb6b063b.jpg alt="The complete unit"></p><p>Later this week I‚Äôll be adding the <a href="http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/rfm12pi-v2-raspberry-pi-expansion-board/">RFM12B Pi expansion board</a>, which will take a bit of rejigging. I‚Äôll post photos once it‚Äôs working.</p><h3 id=software>Software</h3><p>Because this unit is likely to suffer from power outages (amusingly we had one just 10 minutes before writing this sentence) I‚Äôve opted to use the <a href="http://nutcom.hu/?page_id=108">Industrial Perennial Environment</a>. It also happened that there‚Äôs an <a href=http://emoncms.org>emoncms</a> gateway project using IPE (see <a href="http://harizanov.com/2013/08/rock-solid-rfm2pi-gateway-solution/">here</a> for more information).</p><p>As my intention is to run emoncms to capture historical data from the system as well as from a bunch of environmental and energy sensors, I used the pre-built ‚Äúrock solid gateway‚Äù image as my base.</p><p>When you‚Äôre working with IPE, you just need the commands ipe-ro and ipe-rw, which remount the disk in (unsurprisingly) R/O and R/W mode respectively. Just don‚Äôt forget to switch it back once you‚Äôre finished editing.</p><p>I‚Äôm assuming the Pi could die at any time, so I don‚Äôt keep anything on it I‚Äôve not got stored somewhere else. A simple way to achieve this is to create a Github repository for the directory you‚Äôre adding scripts to, but be a little careful about exposing private passwords and API keys to the world. The scripts below are in a repository <a href=https://github.com/spikeheap/pi-switch-post>here</a>.</p><p>To get the Pi into a working state from the base SD card image I did the following:</p><ol><li>Login with root/root</li><li>Resize the partition to fill the SD card: <code>$ firstboot</code></li><li>Run firstboot again to set the root password (among other things): <code>$ firstboot</code></li></ol><p>The next step is to get the networking up and running. I wanted a static IP address of 192.168.0.222 on the wired interface just in case I need to get into it manually. I need the PiHut Wifi dongle to DHCP onto our secure(ish) network (don‚Äôt forget to <code>ipe-rw</code> first!):</p><noscript><pre>auto lo

In <code>/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf</code> add a <code>#</code> to comment out the i2c module so it looks like this: <code>bash #blacklist i2c-bcm2708</code> Then add the following modules to <code>/etc/modules</code>: <code>bash i2c-bcm2708 i2c-dev</code> I also installed the handy i2c-tools:</p><pre><code class=language-bash>sudo apt-get install i2c-tools 
</code></pre><p>To make use of the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi we‚Äôll need the excellent <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">WiringPi library</a>.</p><pre><code class=language-bash>git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi 
sudo ./build

git clone https://github.com/Gadgetoid/WiringPi2-Python.git 
cd WiringPi2-Python
sudo python setup.py install
</code></pre><p>We also need to install the Python smbus module for i2c support: <code>bash sudo apt-get install python-smbus</code></p><p>After a quick reboot you can test the <code>gpio</code> utility and see the GPIO status:</p><pre><code class=language-bash>root@oemgateway:~# gpio readall

You can activate it without having to reboot:</p><pre><code class=language-bash>sudo modprobe rtc-ds1307
</code></pre><p>Assuming the system time is correct (note: check it!) we then want to load add the device and set it to match the system time:</p><pre><code class=language-bash>echo ds1307 0x68 &gt; /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/new_device
hwclock -w
</code></pre><p>To load the device on reboot and update system time from the RTC add the following to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> (you‚Äôll want to run it once manually as well):</p><pre><code class=language-bash>echo ds1307 0x68 &gt; /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/new_device
hwclock -s
</code></pre><h3 id=logging-the-temperature-to-emoncms>Logging the temperature to emoncms</h3><p>The first step is to read the temperature from the TMP100NA (see https://github.com/spikeheap/pi-switch-post/blob/master/readTemp.py):</p><pre><code class=language-python>import smbus

# Print degrees Celsius (I have no idea where I got 0.0625 from...)
print (((msb &lt;&lt; 8) | lsb) &gt;&gt; 4) * 0.0625
</code></pre><p>To get the temperature logged to <a href="http://emoncms.org/">emoncms</a> we just need to get the results from the script and lob it at the REST API see <a href=https://github.com/spikeheap/pi-switch-post/blob/master/tempToEmon.sh>the source</a>:</p><pre><code>curl "http://emoncms.org/api/post?apikey=YOURAPIKEYHERE&amp;json={piTemp:`python /root/pi-switch-post/readTemp.py`}"
</code></pre><h3 id=getting-some-heat>Getting some heat</h3><p>Controlling the relay is pretty straightforward, and we just need to take the pin (24 for A) high or low, as needed:</p><pre><code>wiringpi.pinMode(24,1)

wiringpi.digitalWrite(24, 1) #replace 1 for 0 to switch it off
