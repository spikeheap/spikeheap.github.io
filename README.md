## Requirements when considering alternatives

1. Honour permalinks from days gone by. The format for links is https://ryanbrooks.co.uk/posts/2016-05-19-nginx-docker-proxy/
2. Slashes are optional. The following could both exist in the wild.
  - https://ryanbrooks.co.uk/posts/2016-05-19-nginx-docker-proxy
  - https://ryanbrooks.co.uk/posts/2016-05-19-nginx-docker-proxy/
3. Github-flavour markdown, including code blocks, are present in posts.
4. Code blocks must be syntax highlighted!
5. Tweets are included using <Tweet id="idxxxxxx"></Tweet>
