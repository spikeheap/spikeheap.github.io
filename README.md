# How is this site built?

I've built this site using [Awestruct](http://awestruct.org) with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I'm slowly getting to grips with [AsciiDoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) and prefer it as a method of writing blog posts and technical articles.

I host the site on GitHub pages, so deploying a new post or version of the site is as easy as merging to `master`.
