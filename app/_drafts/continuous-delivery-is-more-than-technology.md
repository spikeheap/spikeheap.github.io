## Ranty ramblings

#### The risk: all rush, all the time

Continous delivery is often sought after because it decreases the time between a feature being 'done' and it being available on production. This is a worthwhile goal, shortening the feedback cycle, reducing the pain felt by long-running branches, and getting rid of the pre-deploy worry when you have a few hundred commits going out in a single release.
