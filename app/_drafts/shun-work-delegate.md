You hear it everywhere: 'if you want something doing well, do it yourself'. Maybe the primary source is beleaguered managers in stagnant organisations where delivering on promises is the exception rather than the rule, who knows. 

That message ingrained itself in me as I grew up. When I started managing people and projects it took a huge effort to let go of the critical tasks, and not only to trust people to do the work well, but also to accept that 'doing it well' might actually involve doing it differently to how I would have.  

As a specialising generalist I've forged my career so far by trying to understand everything, and to be able to at least get by in most areas of technology. At home I take pride in being able to (just about) fix things and [hack the physical world](/posts/2013-12-01-pi-powered-central-heating-phase-1/) to meet our needs. Plus, getting outside with and chopping logs or fixing bikes is a nice distraction after a day in front of the computer. 

In short, I want to do everything, or at least be involved in everything. I want to understand what's going on in the world around me, fuelled by curiosity and the feeling that I _should_ be able to do it.

The problem I've faced recently, though, is that I don't have enough time. Or rather, I don't get enough of the things I __really__ care about done. Moving to contract work has opened up a whole new world of things for me to learn and take on: accounting, law, marketing, operations; and all of that happens outside of 'business hours' when I'm working with clients.

The Internet is full of answers, though they mostly seem to revolve around sleeping less or watching less TV. I'm sure getting up earlier works for many, but I like my 8 hours sleep (when I get it) and don't want to lose productivity later on as it catches up with me. 

If I end up in front of the TV it's usually because I've run out of cognitive capacity and need a bit of downtime, so while watching less TV is a good idea, the benefit is in spending more time with the ones I love and getting outside. 

I may be painting a bleak picture, but over the past few weeks a couple of things have had a positive impact on how much I 'get stuff done':

1. Delegating as much as possible, and anything that doesn't get me closer to my goal.
2. Working through tiny tasks in time that I'd usually just lose.

#### Delegate it all


#### Making dead time work
